# Guidr

## Marketing pages

Guidr helps back country guides of all types log their private/professional trips.  Guides will be able to use Guidr to build their Outdoor Resume. Users can login, create read and update their trips with a trip type, location, duration and whether it's private or professional.

## Task 1:  User can sign up as a "Guide" by providing a unique username and a password that will serve as their login/authentication credentials. (mobile, web)

## Task 2: User can successfully login as a "Guide" with their login credentials from account creation. (mobile, web)

## Task 3: Authenticated "Guide" can access a minimum of two main views:

	- (mobile, web): A "Trips" page where they can:

		1. View a list of previous trips they have created. This should provide an overview of each trip. 
		2. Select a trip from the list and be presented with a detailed view that displays all of the trip's properties.
		3. Create a trip. A "trip" must have at a minimum, the following properties:
			* `title` - String
			* `description` - String
			* `isPrivate` - Boolean
			* `isProfessional` - Boolean
			* an `images` property, type determined by your implementation.
			* `duration` - double
			* `distance` - double
			* `date` - timestamp
			* `tripType` - String or Enum
		4. Update a trip, or any property of a trip.
		5. Delete a trip.

	- (mobile, web): A "Profile" page where they can:
		1. Assign values to profile properties via text fields. At a minimum, a "Profile" must have the following: title, tagline (short description), type of guide specialty), age and years experience.
			* `title` - String
			* `tagline` - String
			* `guideSpecialty` - String
			* `age` - Integer

## Task 1: Implement remote storage for `images` with an API of your choice - i.e. Cloudinary, CloudKit, etc. (web, mobile)


## Task 2: Based on the "duration" of each trip, in hours, aggregate the trip durations and have a widget that displays how many private and professional hours a "Guide" has across their various categories.


## Task 3: Implement a feature that allows a "Guide" to send/print their outdoor resume in PDF format to give to potential employers, guide licensing organizations, etc.
